# Week4: Progress Report

### **Week of 09/19/2024**

**Diagram**:

**Brief Explanation:**

Diagram Explanation: 

I chose the¬†Transportation & Mobility Ecosystem¬†because I use public transportation every day.

The ecosystem revolves around my smartphone, which connects to transit apps for real-time schedule updates, payment systems and transportation networks.

Information Flow: Data flows from transit systems to the apps on my phone, providing live updates about schedules and traffic conditions. My GPS location also helps the apps recommend the best routes.

Feedback Loops: Real-time updates influence my choices, like taking alternative routes when delays occur. Over time, apps use my travel history to provide better suggestions, while contactless payments track my usage, offering rewards system.

**Personal Performance Reflection:**

Introduction to New Tools and Technologies:

This week, I started using Postman, a platform for API testing, and Photon, a tool for physical computing. Both are expanding my technical capabilities and project possibilities.

Hands-on Experience in the Woodshop:

I also used a woodshop saw to cut wood, gaining practical experience in material manipulation and understanding safety and precision in woodworking.
Accidentally found a human face too.

**Challenges and Learnings:**

Working with the woodshop saw was challenging due to the need for precise measurements and adherence to safety protocols. This experience enhanced my practical skills with wood as a material.

**Reflection and Future Directions:**

By exploring both digital and physical tools, I plan to further develop my skills with Postman and Photon, and continue improving in hand-on working. These skills will help in integrating software with physical computing for future technology-driven projects.




# Week3: Progress Report

### **Week of 09/12/2024**

**Exploring Advanced Design Techniques:**

<img width="500" alt="voronoi" src="assets/voronoi.jpg">

This week, I expanded my technical skills by learning how to use Voronoi diagrams within Rhino Grasshopper. This technique allowed me to create more complex and visually appealing designs, which adds a new dimension to my work. 

**Experimenting with Resin Printing:**

I conducted my first trial with resin printing myself, which was an exciting, albeit time-consuming, process. Despite the challenges, mastering this technique was rewarding. The hands-on experience also taught me about the different physical properties of various resin materials. The resin I chose required multiple washes post-printing, adding to the complexity but enhancing the final product's quality.

**Utilizing Markforged Machine:**

Additionally, I experimented with the Markforged machine to print using carbon fiber nylon filament. This was particularly intriguing as it introduced me to the capabilities and potential of printing with reinforced materials, which could be crucial for future robust design applications.

**Challenges with 3D Printing Accuracy:**

One of the setbacks this week was my attempt to model and print a 3D hinge with the box together. Unfortunately, the print failed due to issues with printing accuracy. This has highlighted the need for further experiments to refine the process and achieve the desired precision.

**Ongoing Projects and Plans:**

Amidst these experiments, I am still in the process of finalizing the perfect packaging solution for my jewelry brand. This remains a critical component of my project, as the packaging must not only be protective but also reflect the aesthetic and quality of the jewelry inside.





# Week2: Progress Report

### **Week of 09/12/2024**

Following the tutorial, I practiced basic Rhino modeling before experimenting with the Grasshopper file for a phone stand.

I managed to modify the parameters and "baked" a new model by experimenting with the phone stand file. The process helped me understand the underlying logic of parametric design.

I then drew a diagram illustrating the logic flow behind the phone stand, which clarified the process.

In addition, I also followed another youtube tutorial and made a parametric box by using Grasshopper. It solidifies my understanding of parametric design and the logic flow behind it.

# Week1: Progress Report

### **Week of 08/26/2024**

### **Reflections**

**What I Learned:**

This week, I focused on learning the basics of the Kuka KR 6 R900-2 Agilus Robots, nicknamed Lucy and Ethel at jacobs. I explored their mechanical and software interfaces, essential for precise automation tasks.

**How I Learned It:**

My learning involved hands-on workshops and peer discussions, which helped me understand the robots' capabilities and limitations.

**Assessment of Work:**

My work with the robots is at a beginner stage. I've controlled the arm to do basic task and am exploring more complex operations.

**Challenges Encountered:**

I tried using a robotic arm to draw my jewelry brand's logo. The result was slightly off due to the pen's tip not being fine enough for detailed line designs.

**Future Directions:**

This experience has shown the importance of matching the right tools with robotic systems for precision tasks. It will guide my future projects requiring precise robotic interactions.

**Speculations**

**Future Direction for the Tools:**

I believe modifying a robotic arm to include a 3D printer extruder could allow printing on uneven surfaces, transforming how we use 3D printing in today‚Äôs manufacturing.

**Future Direction for the Work:**

Using the Omax Waterjet Cutter has inspired me to pursue designs that were previously too complex due to material constraints, thanks to its precise cutting capabilities.

# Github Background Information & Context
If you‚Äôre new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that‚Äôs hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it‚Äôs super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link!  As a start, feel free to simply add images to the `/assets` folder, which is located [here](/assets). 

The specific file that I‚Äôm typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (üí° TIP: The .md indicates that we‚Äôre using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (üí° TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis üòÑ</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the ‚Äúfront page‚Äù of your GitHub repo. This is where we‚Äôll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/24f-desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions#weekly-progress-report). They might look something like this: ###
