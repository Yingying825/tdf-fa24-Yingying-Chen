# Week2: Progress Report

### **Week of 09/12/2024**

Following the tutorial, I practiced basic Rhino modeling before experimenting with the Grasshopper file for a phone stand.

I managed to modify the parameters and "baked" a new model by experimenting with the phone stand file. The process helped me understand the underlying logic of parametric design.

I then drew a diagram illustrating the logic flow behind the phone stand, which clarified the process.

In addition, I also followed another youtube tutorial and made a parametric box by using Grasshopper. It solidifies my understanding of parametric design and the logic flow behind it.

# Week1: Progress Report

### **Week of 08/26/2024**

### **Reflections**

**What I Learned:**

This week, I focused on learning the basics of the Kuka KR 6 R900-2 Agilus Robots, nicknamed Lucy and Ethel at jacobs. I explored their mechanical and software interfaces, essential for precise automation tasks.

**How I Learned It:**

My learning involved hands-on workshops and peer discussions, which helped me understand the robots' capabilities and limitations.

**Assessment of Work:**

My work with the robots is at a beginner stage. I've controlled the arm to do basic task and am exploring more complex operations.

**Challenges Encountered:**

I tried using a robotic arm to draw my jewelry brand's logo. The result was slightly off due to the pen's tip not being fine enough for detailed line designs.

**Future Directions:**

This experience has shown the importance of matching the right tools with robotic systems for precision tasks. It will guide my future projects requiring precise robotic interactions.

**Speculations**

**Future Direction for the Tools:**

I believe modifying a robotic arm to include a 3D printer extruder could allow printing on uneven surfaces, transforming how we use 3D printing in today‚Äôs manufacturing.

**Future Direction for the Work:**

Using the Omax Waterjet Cutter has inspired me to pursue designs that were previously too complex due to material constraints, thanks to its precise cutting capabilities.

# Hello DES INV 202 Student!
Welcome to your new GitHub repository!

# Github Background Information & Context
If you‚Äôre new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that‚Äôs hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it‚Äôs super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link!  As a start, feel free to simply add images to the `/assets` folder, which is located [here](/assets). 

The specific file that I‚Äôm typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (üí° TIP: The .md indicates that we‚Äôre using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (üí° TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis üòÑ</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the ‚Äúfront page‚Äù of your GitHub repo. This is where we‚Äôll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/24f-desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions#weekly-progress-report). They might look something like this: ###

# Week 1: Example Report 1 #
## Week of 09/05/2024

This week, I designed a cool phone stand made of rocks. Check out all my cool sketches and progress photos from this week below, etc., etc....

It's time to start making this space your own! If you want to save these instructions, make a copy.  Also, feel empowered to delete everything in this README.md and start documenting! 

Excited to work with you,
your TDF teaching team
